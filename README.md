# rootFileRenamer

## How to install:

### 1. Make sure you have installed tesseract v5.3.3
Can be downloaded from this link: [download tesseract](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.20231005.exe) <!--{:target="_blank"}-->

### 2. Run tesseract setup

newest version
[rootFileRenamer download](https://github.com/Rxsengxn/rootFileRenamer/blob/kert_development/rootFileRenamer_v2.exe)

  ~~[link to the file in drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bng2jYmbb5rFycDoCGr7fWBjbaGMldYA/view?usp=sharing)~~

The file is safe for downloading. (You might have to tell Windows that)
Source code is available in this repository.

### 4. Make sure the pictures are in a separate folder and the path does not include any special characters and spaces
The program can't currently handle a path with them. (fixing probably in the future)

## How to run:

### Run the script %%.exe :)
Controls should be pretty self explanatory:
- On first run it asks the user for the folder location where the pictures are located and the name of the output folder
- "y"-(yes), "n"-(no), "b"-(back) or "s"-(skip) while the picture window is focused/active
- enter the correct symbol combination into the input box field when the program can't find anything or has detected it wrongly
(can be lowercase, it converts it to uppercase automatically; enter with Enter key :))
> **_NOTE📝:_**  The program writes "X" at the start of the file if the output folder already has a file with the same name
