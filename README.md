# rootFileRenamer

## How to install:

### 1. Make sure you have installed tesseract v5.3.3
Can be downloaded from this link: [download tesseract](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.3.20231005.exe) <!--{:target="_blank"}-->

  ~~[link to the file in drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bng2jYmbb5rFycDoCGr7fWBjbaGMldYA/view?usp=sharing)~~

The file is safe for downloading.
Source code is available in this repository.

### 4. Make sure the pictures are in a separate folder and the path does not include any special characters and spaces
The program can't currently handle a path with them. (fixing probably in the future)

## How to run:

### Run the script %%.exe :)
Controls should be pretty self explanatory:
- Firstly it asks the user for the folder location where the pictures are located
- "y" or "n" while the picture window is focused/active
- enter the correct symbol combination into the input box field when the program can't find anything or has detected it wrongly
(can be lowercase, it converts it to uppercase; enter with Enter key :))
> **_NOTE📝:_**  The program overwrites the existing file if it has the same name
